> [Kreuzberger et. al](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.02302) stipulate, *"The final goal of all industrial machine learning (ML) projects is to develop ML products and rapidly bring them into production."* Cannlytics AI is no exception. The aim of Cannlytics AI is to develop and implement fully-functioning machine learning products for people in the cannabis space to use and interact with.
