# Change Log

## 6/16/2021 v0.0.6

Refactored code and ensured that all code is licensed under a [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) so labs are free to use the software in their laboratory information management systems (LIMS).

Addressing the following issues in Cannlytics [first milestone](https://github.com/cannlytics/cannlytics/milestones):

- [Create user interface to send and receive data to and from Firestore for main LIMS models.](https://github.com/cannlytics/cannlytics/issues/5)
- [Integrate the user interface with the Metrc module.](https://github.com/cannlytics/cannlytics/issues/6)
- [Ability to add specific fields/keys to forms.](https://github.com/cannlytics/cannlytics/issues/7)
- [Scientific instrument parsing logic.](https://github.com/cannlytics/cannlytics/issues/8)
- [Result calculations.](https://github.com/cannlytics/cannlytics/issues/9)
- [CoA generation.](https://github.com/cannlytics/cannlytics/issues/10)

The Cannlytics LIMS should be usable by 6/23/2021 with minimal functionality:

- Receive transfers from Metrc.
- Enter analysis data.
- Parse scientific instrument data.
- Create certificates of analysis (CoAs).
- Post results to Metrc.
