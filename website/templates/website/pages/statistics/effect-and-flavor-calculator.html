  <!-- About the API -->
  <h1>API</h1>
  <p>
    Tell your developer about our effects and aromas calculator
    that you can use with our free API. If you're paying for
    quality control tests and/or terpene tests, then you may
    as well have the effects and aromas of your products predicted.
  </p>
  <p>
    For each prediction, you receive the estimated probability and
    accuracy of a consumer reporting the effect or flavor. Simply
    input cannabinoid and or terpene data and you receive a
    surprisingly useful prediction of potential effects and flavors
    that your consumers may report.
  </p>
  <p>
    The cherry on top is that you can report back the actual
    effects and flavors that you believe best characterizes
    your product and the algorithm becomes that much smarter!
    So, you can help improve the prediction model with each
    prediction if you opt-in to providing feedback. Once again,
    your developer can use our free API to communicate your
    feedback if you desire.
  </p>
