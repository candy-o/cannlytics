    <p>
      The effects model is used to predict effects and aromas that
      may be reported for a given product given its lab results. 
      For technical details of the model, please see the
      <a href="https://github.com/cannlytics/cannlytics">documentation</a>.
      Please remember that the predictions are simply statistics are
      should not be mistaken as claims.
    </p>

  <!-- About the API -->
  <section class="markdown">

  <h2 class="mt-5">API</h2>
  <p>
    Tell your developer(s) about our <a href="https://github.com/cannlytics/cannlytics">free effects and aromas API</a>! If you're paying for quality control tests and/or terpene tests, then you may
    as well have the effects and aromas of your products predicted.
    Simply input cannabinoid and/or terpene data and you will receive a
    surprisingly useful prediction of effects and aromas.
    The cherry üçí on top is that you can report back the actual
    effects and aromas that characterize your product and the
    model becomes that much smarter!
    So, you can make your predictions better over time
    if you opt-in to providing feedback.
    Please explore at your pleasure and, hopefully, you are able to find many clever uses for the statistics.
