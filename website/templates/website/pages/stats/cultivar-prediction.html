  <p>
    With the Cultivar Identification prediction model, you can distinguish between strains in seconds!
    The model identifies the dimensions that are statistically different between samples of the two strains.
    Simply submit lab results that you have for each strain and the model will determine any
    statistical difference between the strains.
