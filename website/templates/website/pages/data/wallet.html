You will need to connect an ERC-20 compatible wallet to manage your ETH and OCEAN tokens.
At this time, we have setup the market to work with the
<a href="" target="_blank">MetaMask</a> browser plugin-in wallet.
Your wallet stores your private keys.

Once your wallet is set up, it will have one or more accounts.
Each account has one private key and one address.
You must keep the private key secret.
You can share the address with others, in fact,
you will need to share your addresss with someone in order for them to send ETH or OCEAN to your account.

Not that unlike traditional pocket wallets, crypto wallets don't actually store ETH or OCEAN.
They store private keys.
